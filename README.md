Measuring Annotated Homology
While annotated protein sequences are widely used in machine learning applications, pre-processing these sequences regarding homology is mainly limited to clustering complete sequences based on global alignment without considering their annotations. Here, I am introducing new tools that identify all possible local homologies between annotated sequences within the same or across two datasets and then resolve these homologies.
